## What is ErjaBot?

ErjaBot is a bot lives in a RaspberryPi and it's able to meet you via [Twitter Account of Erjabot](http://www.twitter.com/erjabot).

The main aim of this project is creating a bot that recognize followers of an account on Twitter. This bot is currently super early bird stage. I will add new features.But now this bot just learn who is following them and creating a well-detailed database about followers.This database will be public in later times.

<code>schedule</code> : To keep database updated, and run learning algorithms periodically.
